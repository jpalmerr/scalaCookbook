# Choosing a Collection Class

- sequence
- map
- set

## Choosing a sequence

When choosing a *sequence* you have two main decisions:
- Should the sequence be indexed?
- Mutable, immutable?

|         | Immutable      |   Mutable     |
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|
| Indexed   | Vector |   ArrayBuffer   |
| Linear (Linked lists) | List |   ListBuffer |

## Choosing a map

Applying a function on something
e.g. OO looping
- default is immutable
